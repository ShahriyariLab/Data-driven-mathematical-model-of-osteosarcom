# Data-driven-mathematical-model-of-osteosarcom
Every osteosarcoma tumor has unique characteristics, thus different tumors might respond differently to the same treatment. In this work, we develop a data driven mathematical model to study the key interactions between the immune system and osteosarcoma microenvironment. Patients with osteosarcoma are divided into three clusters based on their relative abundance of immune cells estimated from their gene expression data. We then analyze the progression of tumor and the effects of the immune system on caner growth in each cluster.
